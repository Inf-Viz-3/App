# Meetings

This contains the meeting notes for each week.

# Week 6
## Done
- Color distribution bubble chart to stacked bar chart
- Layout
- Timeslider with warped faces
- Filtering on certain aspects
- Adjustments to pipeline
- Face simaliarity calculation

## Meeting
- Simple solution for similar face
- Heat map colors just make 50 groups or so
- Time line: line plot to bar plot
- Make things more clear. So time line amount of faces make it more clear. Also for stacked bar chart
- Demo is on Friday 20th 9-12 (9-10:30 or 10:30 - 12). You get a spot with a table and you show it on your laptop.
    - Email for the time slot
    - 3 min pitch: story and you get some questions
- Tuesday from 1-3 could get an extra team meeting

# Week 5
## Done
- Finishing up the heatmap
- Preparing all the features in one pipeline
- Making a scroll (over-) view page

## Meeting

### landmarks
Face points per face and then in a row diverging further and further from the average.
Average vector calculate all differences

### Discussion part of the paper:
Visual analytics: the noise of data can be corrected by a user by clicking the image and make a feedback loop. We are not going to do this because we should warp the faces again in the background. And it will shift the project from data visualisation to visual analytics

### Paper:
- Guidelines use template and page limit

### Extra stuff?
- average standard deviation of skin tone
- Better positioning of components
- More data vs better visualisation, go for better visualisation 
- If you do all this compute then it will be rewarded in the grade

Good on track and cool idea!

# Week 4
## Done
- Start building bubble chart with range time slider
- Start of heatmap for skincolor
- Researching multiple models for extracting features

## Meeting
- Face main part
- Heat map showing only the line of century. 
 - Click on century folds out to more specific view (original heatmap)

# Week 3
- Prepare boilerplate code
- Pitched the idea of a time line correlation visualization against objects/concepts to Gjorgji
- Changed the idea to portrait art work
  -  The view on beauty changes over time. Therefore we use the OmniArt dataset to filter the portraits and see what the color usage is (at first). For example back in the day pale skin was a sign of beauty, later on this changed.
- Use of OmniEye dataset
- Use of OmniEye generator

# Week 2

- Understand and evaluate the following datasets:
    - Reddit
        - Mostly graph data / lack of images
    - Flickr
        - NUS-Wide is a subset of the Standford Flickr Web Relations
        - Stanford dataset is mostly graphs with some additional data from each of the sub-datasets (e.g., NUW-Wide)
    - OmniArt
- Discuss topics with TA
    - Decision on OmniArt as the dataset
    - Focus Visual Information project

# Week 1 - Project Setup / Initialization

- Brainstorming on Visualization Analytics and Visual Information - What do we want to implement
- Select focus on specific datasets
    - OmniArt
    - Reddit or Flickr
- Individual projects
- Setup Trello / Communication channels
